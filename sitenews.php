	Welcome</h2>
<p>
	This website aims to be the top resource for video game scraping via our API. We strive to have the highest quality available in our artwork and metadata. This site is open and entirely community driven, and relies on user submissions for content. We host Fanart, Banners, Covers, and Metadata that can be incorporated into media center front-ends for HTPC&#39;s in various ways. Please feel free to contribute!</p>
